# micalibration_suite
### A module to perform microphone calibrations catering to my own calibration workflow

### For more details please read my perhaps all-too detailed description in the HTML version of the notebook used to develop this workflow. The HTML file ('Calibration calibration....') is huge and Github won't display it directly - please download and save it as a HTML file. You should then be able to open it and look at the description of the playback sequence + the broad methodology involved.
